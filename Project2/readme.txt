This project was code in Window System by Eclipse

1.This project include a complete HMM model.
2.Main functions:mle, em, forward, backward, Viterbi, expection, maximization,
predict.
3.this project can calculate the accuracy of predicting a labeled corpus.
4.HMM.java is the main java file. Please see commitment carefully.
5.filehandler.java can handle with both labeded and unlabeled data.
6.results/p2/accuracy.txt contains the accuracy when mu is {0,0.1,0.2...,1}
7.results/p2/likelyhood.txt contains 30 data for each iteration in em.
8.accuracy.py and likelyhood.py are two pyhton file to plot the figure.
9.likelihood.py is used to plot the likelihood figure.
10.All results are put in results folder. Resourse data is in the data folder. Jar folder contains the extra .jar file.

please make sure your running environment is available!!
