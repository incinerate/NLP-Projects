first
c.mma

that

it

it
's
solid
as
a

c.mma
edge
guards

a
pig
snout

looks
like
a

contrary
to
another
review
c.mma
the
ac

fits
into
a

inside

it

be
stored
internally

it
also

makes
this

i
try
these

c.mma
to
my

c.mma
my

has
seen
nothing
short
of
a
transformation!here
is
the
gorgeous
tone
i
had
missed!i
am
now
on
my
second
set
of
strings
c.mma
and
i
am
hooked.one
thing
c.l.n
i
have
heard
that
these
strings
are
n't
as
durable
as
other
strings.however
c.mma
this
has
n't
bothered
me
c.mma
as
tend
to
finger-pick
and
soft
strum
c.mma
and
so
c.mma
this
possibility
has
n't
become
an
issue
for
me.and
while
i
would
make
no
claim
that
everyone
would
have
the
great
experience
i
did
c.mma
i
would
wholeheartedly
recommend
trying
these
strings
to
anyone
looking
for
a
variation
in
tone.the
fact
that
it
is
easier
on
the
fingers
is
another
reason
to
give
these
a
try

bear
in

up

tuning
c.mma
the

was
not

c.mma
the

the

i
like
the

i
'm
definitely
keeping

the
``

is
pretty
useless

when
you
tune
using

then

pick
up

strum

says

the

the

so
buy
it
c.mma

do
it

right

traditional

c.mma
not

once
down

a
rubber
bottom

remove

this
is
simply
one
of
the
best
velcro
tapes
out

it
is
very
well
made

resistant

hold
every

imagined

</s>
<s>
i
would
recommend
to
get
a
few
roles
of
power-grip
pedalboard
velcro
as
it
definetely
holds
your
pedals
much
better
than
the
`
industrial
'
velcros
included
in
most
pedal
boards

a
one-meter
roll
-lrb-
around
3
feet

wont
last
long
c.mma
especially
if
you
have
a
combination
of
both
regular
size

mxr
or
boss
-rrb-

bigger
pedals
like

<s>
you
probably
have
a
few
thousand
dollars
invested
in
great
pedals
c.mma
even
rare
ones
c.mma

this
would
be
great
for
you
to
keep
them
well-attached

properly
organized

could
be
made
a

wider

1/2
an

i
love
this

because

it
's
on
and
not
going
to
come
off
with
bumps

gigging
hard
or
what
not
c.mma

at
the
same
time
if
you
would
need
to
reassemble

want
to
move
pedals
around
c.mma
you
can
take
it
off
.

it
wo
n't
be
easy
c.mma

some
leverage
on
it

something
you
can
wedge
it
off

i
was
able
to
get

it
came
off

able

sell
it

some
good
stuff

be
prepared
to
buy
a

rolls
though

it
hooks
to

you
'll
go
through
it
pretty
quickly

the
velcro
itself

insanely
amazing

amazing

stronger

an
alternative

by
all
means
c.mma
use

the
uke

the

learn
how

play
it
anyway
...
ouch
those
stock

were
rough

the

left
much
to

i
waited

were
installed

this
review.wow
with
the
new

it
is
totally

a

factors
affecting

i
also
felt
that
once
the

the
string
down

thing
that
is
creating
tone

so
at

between
these
two
i
found
no

differences.i
wanted
to
say
that
if
you
are
using
medium
sized
jumbo
frets
and
high
action
you
are
really
bending
the
string
in

to
fret
it

changing
the
pitch

so
if

're

you
would

have
less

anyhow
i
digress
c.mma

for
a
reason

light
gauge
strings
are
subject
to
tuning
problems
if
you
have
big
fat
frets
like
the
.050
&#34;
found
on
gibons
and
esp-ltd
's
.
</s>
<s>
when
you
squeeze
the
string
to
fret
it
c.mma
with
light
gauge
strings
it
is
all
too
easy
to
squeeze
it
all
the
way
to
the
fret
board
.
</s>
<s>
with
x-large
jumbo
frets
that
can
be
quite
a
distance
making
the
guitar
go
out
of
tune
.
</s>
<s>
the
cure
for
that
is
using
heavier
gauge
strings
such
as
10
's
or
more
so
it
makes
it
possible
to
determine
quite
easily
just
where
the
top
of
the
fret
is
without
doing
the
full
squeeze
all
the
way
to
the
fret
board
.
</s>
<s>
so
most
capo
's
work
with
10
's
and
on
up
because
there
is
a
lot
more
tension
on
the
strings
.

<s>
so
a
lot
of
capos
can
create
a
comfortable
fit
fully
fretting
the
strings

them
going
into

sharp
note
zone.so
since
i
use
lighter
gauge
strings
c.mma
and
even
9

subject
to
the

limitation
c.mma
i
have
had
a
hard
time
finding
a
capo
that
would
sit
comfortably
at
the
top
of
the
range
between
the
fret

the
board
c.mma
and
still
squeeze
the
string
sufficiently
so
as
to
not
create
any
buzz
and
do
so
without
making
the
string
too
sharp

okay
back

the

string

stays
in

wavering
off
to
one
side
.
</s>

the
only
problem
is
that

seen
they
are
n't
superbly
accurate
.

<s>
-lrb-
the
peterson
headstock
tuner
i
sent
back
because
it
was
acting
crazy
.
</s>
<s>
anyhow
...
-rrb-
so
the
secret
to
using
the
snark
which
i
like
best
out
of
the
headstock
tuners
i
have
tried
is
to
tune
the
open
string
first
c.mma
and
then
fret
the
string
on
let
's
say
the
5th
fret
.
</s>
<s>
you
will
occasionally
find
that
a
string
in
the
open
position
registers
as
being
in
tune
c.mma
even
though
it
may
be
a
little
sharp
c.mma
or
a
little
flat
c.mma
so
when
you
strum
the
whole
chord
you
will
get
a
desire
to
tune
it
c.mma
so
your
ears
can
hear
it
c.mma
in
order
to
get
it
spot
on
.
</s>
<s>
there
is
nothing
more
beautiful
than
a
perfectly
tuned
guitar
c.mma
and
nothing
worse
than
one
that
is
well
out
of
tune.so
by
tuning
the
open
string
c.mma
and
then
tuning
the
fretted
string
c.mma
once
both
are
in
tune
it
is
right
on

<s>
so
in
the
open
position
if
by
chance
it
is
a
tiny
bit
sharp
c.mma
not
enough
to
register
on
the
tuner
c.mma
when
you
fret
that
string
c.mma
for
example
on
the
5th
fret
that
naturally
stretches
the
string
a
little
bit
c.mma
making
it
sharper
c.mma
which
will
now
show
on
the
snark
as
a
note
that
is
too
sharp

once
you
balance
the

c.mma

the

i
've
been
thinking
about
trying
the
nanoweb
strings
for
a
while
c.mma

i
was
a
bit
put
off
by
the
high
price
-lrb-
they
cost
about
twice
as
much
as
the
uncharted
strings
i
've
been
buying
-rrb-
and
the
comments
of
some
reviewers
that
the
tone
of
coated
strings
is
noticeably
duller
.

<s>
i
was
intrigued
by
the
promise
of
long
life
c.mma
though
;
i
have
a
taylor
big
baby
that
i
bought
used
c.mma
and
which
came
with
a
set
of
nanowebs
that
had
probably
been
on
it
for
a
year
-
and
they
did
n't
sound
at
all
like
old
strings
.
</s>
<s>
this
review
set
gave
me
a
chance
to
finally
see
for
myself
how
they
sound
when
new.i
'd
just
changed
the
strings
on
my
1970s
gibson
gospel
a
week
ago
c.mma
so
i
decided
that
would
be
my
reference
.
</s>
<s>
the
nanowebs
went
on
my
1970s
guild
d-35
.
</s>
<s>
both
are
well
broken
in
c.mma
solid
spruce
top
guitars
.
</s>
<s>
the
gospel
is
a
bit
brighter
sounding
c.mma
but
i
'm
pretty
familiar
with
the
sound
of
both
guitars
.
</s>
<s>
if
they
d-35
sounded
dull
c.mma
i
'd
notice.as
i
was
unwrapping
the
nanowebs
i
noticed
that
while
they
were
labeled
``
light
''
gauge
c.mma
they
had
a
0.013
''
e
string
-
something
you
'd
be
more
likely
to
find
on
a
set
of
medium
gauge
strings
.
</s>
<s>
the
b
was
a
.017
c.mma
compared
to
the
.016
of
the
d'addarios
i
usually
play
.
</s>
<s>
the
rest
of
the
strings
were
there
usual
light
gauges
.
</s>
<s>
turns
out
that
these
are
``
hd
light
''
gauge
c.mma
designed
to
have
a
slightly
more
tension
and
better
articulation
at
the
high
end
.
</s>
<s>
the
difference
should
n't
be
enough
to
require
any
truss
rod
adjustment
so
i
went
ahead
and
installed
them
on
the
d-35
.
</s>
<s>
so
how
do
they
sound
?
</s>
<s>
the
unwound
e
and
b
do
n't
sound
different
from
any
other
plain
steel
string
c.mma
of
course
.
</s>
<s>
the
e
does
feel
a
tiny
bit
stiffer
c.mma
when
i
switch
between
the
d-35
and
the
gospel
.
</s>
<s>
sound-wise
c.mma
i
'd
say
they
sound
like
a
good
set
that
have
been
on
a
guitar
for
a
day
.
</s>
<s>
i
would
n't
call
them
dull
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
.
</s>
<s>
if
i
did
n't
know
that
they
were
coated
strings
i
certainly
would
n't
be
able
to
tell
from
playing
them
.
</s>
<s>
so
they
're
good
sounding
strings
c.mma
and
they
last
a
long
time
.
</s>
<s>
that
leaves
the
question
of
cost
-
are
they
worth
twice
the
price
of
uncoated
strings?here
's
the
way
i
see
it
c.l.n
if
you
're
a
heavy
strummer
c.mma
or
playing
gigs
every
night
c.mma
maybe
not
.
</s>
<s>
you
're
probably
breaking
strings
or
losing
them
to
metal
fatigue
long
before
they
'd
go
dull
from
corrosion
or
contamination
.
</s>
<s>
but
if
you
're
a
finger
picker
c.mma
or
a
light
strummer
c.mma
a
coated
string
will
probably
save
you
a
lot
of
money
in
the
long
run
.
</s>
<s>
and
if
you
're
a
hobby
player
who
keeps
a
guitar
around
the
house
c.mma
and
picks
it
up
once
in
a
while
to
entertain
friends
or
family
c.mma
coated
strings
are
probably
an
excellent
choice
.
</s>
<s>
for
myself
c.mma
i
'm
going
to
leave
these
on
the
d-35
for
as
long
as
they
still
sound
good
.

i
'll
update
this
review

i
find
out
just
how
long
they
do
last.follow
up
c.l.n
after
playing
these
for
a
few
days
c.mma
i
actually
went
out
and
bought
a
set
in
the
same
gauge
for
my
loar
lh-350
c.mma
an
arch
top
guitar
with
a
carved
top
that
gets
played
more
than
any
of
my
other
guitars

they
sound
great

i
have
two
guitars

these
strings

i
give

4.5

not
