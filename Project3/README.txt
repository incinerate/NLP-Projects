This project was coded in Window System by Eclipse

1. Generator.java is used for generating sentences by given grammar. You can set the number of sentence to generate. The result will be output in results/sentence.txt.
2. Parse.java is used for parse sentences. It can generate one parse tree for each sentence. The result will output into results/parse.java

Note: Unluckly, Sun Lab was closed on Friday evening so I couldn't test my code on Sun Lab machines. I can't run .sh file on my own laptop, therefore I write the sentence.txt and parse.txt in results folder. If my project doesn't work well, you can check my code carefully and see my results.
